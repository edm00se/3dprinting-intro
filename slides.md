# Types and Safety

# FDM/FFF

<v-clicks>

- what's this like? ðŸ¤”
- hot = hot, do not touch
- mind the pointy bits, supports, flat pieces on build plate
- advanced materials and fumes

</v-clicks>

<!--
imagine strapping a hot glue gun on a cnc motion control system, what could possibly go wrong?

# Resin

<v-clicks>

- uncured resin scraped off the build plate (solid enough)
- washing, IPA
- support removal
- curing fully

</v-clicks>

<!--
You can get a lot higher detail and incredible results, but the space, time, and cost of processing every single print does add up.

# Multi Material and Multi Color Options

<v-clicks>

- can look amazing
- can combine things that don't normally work together
- keep getting easier
- adds a lot of waste
